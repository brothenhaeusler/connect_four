<h1 id="connect-four---the-game">Connect four - the game</h1>
<p>This game is played in the terminal by executing the <a href="src/four_wins.py">four_wins.py</a> file.</p>
<p>It is developed to be played by 2 players who alternately should get access to the keyboard to make their respective inputs to the game.</p>
<p>The first player gets chosen randomly by the computer, so it would be good to first agree on whoâ€™s player 1 and 2 first.</p>
<p>The game is modelled after the dimensions of the original connect four game - the feature to play the game within a field of different dimensions may come in following versions.</p>
