# Exercise A: 
See [here](doc/documentation.pdf) - at my documentation

# Exercise B: 

### 1 UML
3 UML diagrams to look at. The diagrams are mostly artificially pumped up :). My core project consists of a command line game.

* A [Use case diagram](doc/uml/use_case_diagram_of_the_gaming_website.pdf) that visualizes different use cases for both the users, the admin and the proprietor.
* A [Sequence diagram](doc/uml/Sequence%20Diagram.pdf) to visualize how different entities of a website 'would' interact in case of a certain procedure of activities.
* An [Activity diagram](doc/uml/Sequence%20Diagram.pdf) that shows an imaginary string of actions and possibilities, when accessing the website. 

### 2 DDD
I modelled the different domains within a Problem space

and the bounded contexts and the relationships between them.

### 3 Metrics
I used Sonarqube for delivering the Metrics as required. The results can be accessed here.

### 4 Clean Code Development
[the cheatsheet](doc/clean_code/cheatsheet%20clean_code.docx)  (Sorry for the format, but that's what I unfortunately have open when programming)
# include link
and [4](doc/clean_code/code_examples) examples, where I applied different clean code principles.
* before: sth about adding 1, modulo, etc.. -- now: embarrassingly [simple](doc/clean_code/code_examples/KISS%20in%20practice.png)
* [no magic numbers](doc/clean_code/code_examples/no%20magic%20numbers.png)
* before: I called the variable 'player' --- now: more [precise naming](doc/clean_code/code_examples/precise%20naming.png)
* [avoidance of negative conditionals and good commenting](doc/clean_code/code_examples/combination.png)

### 5 Build Management
I used a Makefile for local build-management. I didn't do building before (sorry :) ) -- especially automated Unit Tests seem to be quite valuable in the context of later code changes
# link the Makefile

### 6 Unit Tests
Here<> they are. They get automatically run using CICD 
# link to Unit tests

### 7 Continuous Delivery
I used GitHub Action for that purpose. 
# do I have to link sth?

### 8 IDE
I used VisualStudio Code for that effect due to recent (last 5 years) developments and investments through Microsoft. 
Here is my cheatsheet (for Mac)
# include link

### 9 DSL
The DSL implemented by me is used independent from my project. It can be accessed here.
# provide link

### 10 Functional Programming
only final data structures
(mostly) side effect free functions
the use of higher-order functions
functions as parameters and return values
use closures / anonymous functions
