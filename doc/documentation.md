# Connect four - the game

This game is played in the terminal by executing the four_wins.py file. 

It is developed to be played by 2 players who alternately should get access to the keyboard to make their respective inputs to the game. 

The first player gets chosen randomly by the computer, so it would be good to first agree on who's player 1 and 2 first.  

The game is modelled after the dimensions of the original connect four game - the feature to play the game within a field of different dimensions may come in following versions. 

### And now: have some fun :)
